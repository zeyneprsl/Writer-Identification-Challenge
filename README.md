# Writer-Identification-Challenge
This is actually a VPL variant of the ICFHR Author Identification challenge. Google colab gives around 0.96 accuracy approval. In VPL, it has 0.93 accuracy.
The biggest takeaway from this study; The array I found in Collab was giving an error in VLP because it was the default, so I sorted the array in Collab to solve this problem.
